//! `.mgcs` save container — the native save file
//! (`docs/archive/DESIGN-SAVES.md` "Format").
//!
//! Same house pattern as [`crate::mgcl`]: a ZIP with a JSON index and
//! raw little-endian binary members. Two differences, both deliberate:
//!
//! - **Members are DEFLATEd.** `.mgcl` stores everything uncompressed
//!   so identical content yields identical bytes, which the committed
//!   level hashes depend on. Saves are pinned by nothing, and the
//!   payload is ~570 KiB of highly repetitive terrain and entity pool.
//! - **The sim payload is ONE member**, not the `world/*.bin` +
//!   `sim.bin` split the design sketched. The sim's own codec
//!   (`mgc_sim::snapshot`) emits a single versioned stream, and
//!   cutting it up here would put the field layout in two places —
//!   this crate cannot see `mgc-sim`'s types at all (it is the
//!   dependency, not the dependent).
//!
//! A slot always carries the campaign record, and carries the world
//! payload only when the save was taken mid-level. So a slot knows on
//! its own whether it resumes at the hub or drops straight into play,
//! and every slot is loadable from the main menu.
