//! Runs on the SHARED chassis ([`crate::engine::features::Gen`]) — same
//! pool, mailboxes, LCG, terrain samplers. MC2's NewEvent defaults
//! match MC1's field-for-field (life 300, flags dword 8, speed 16,

//!
//! Entity-field mapping (MC2 name → our [`Ent`] field):

//! Per-wizard fields shared with the MC1 column (same gameplay
//! semantics, human = out-of-pool):
//! - `word_0x248_584` (the wizard "wanted" timer, armed to 200 by
//!   offenses against the village; archers only engage wizards with
//!   it live, :11799) → [`Gen::player_aggro`] for the human — the
//!   MC1 militia gate's exact analog.
//! - `word_0x36_54` = 100 on arrow fire (:60598 sub_5EF70) → the
//!   danger-music countdown, [`Gen::player_danger`].
//!
//! DELIBERATE APPROXIMATIONS (cited, revisit as the port widens):
//! - remc2 rebuilds per-tick entity LISTS in slot order (:39930:
//!   wizards → dword_38519, per-model class-5 → bytearray_38403x
//!   skipping 0xB4/0xE8/0xEA, buildings → dword_38527). We scan the
//!   pool in slot order — identical order and tie behavior.
//! - The human wizard lives OUTSIDE the pool: wizard scans visit
//!   the human via [`MobCtx`] first (retail's list is slot-ordered
//!   with the human in slot 1), then pool class-3 wizards.
//! - The arrow's impact effect `sub_10C80(arrow, 0, subSpell)` is
//!   not yet transcribed; the port writes channel-0 area damage of
//!   `f44` through the shared mailbox writer at the impact point —
//!   the same observable (creature inboxes + the player probe).
//!   The `sub_68740` shielded-target ricochet (word[0] & 0x8010)
//!   has no shielded targets in the slice and lands with the MC2
//!   damage arm.
//! - The arrow's hit probe `sub_10780` → our tile-chain victim scan
//!   ([`Gen::victim_scan_at`]'s MC2 twin pending the class-9 pass).
//! - `TransformEntityToManaSphere` spawns spheres through the MC1
//!   (10,39) ball ctor and writes the MC2 launch fields into the
//!   MC1 ball's field homes so the shared ball tick flies them —
//!   until MC2's own (10,39) handler is diffed.
//! - `sub_20130` (archer base+6) is MISSING from the decompile
//!   (gap between //2010f0 and //201140); unreachable for archers
//!   (row flags bit 8 clear) — stubbed as hold-state.
//! - The global creature counter (`dword_0x364D2--` on the boxed-in
//!   suicide, :8860) has no reader in the slice; not tracked.
