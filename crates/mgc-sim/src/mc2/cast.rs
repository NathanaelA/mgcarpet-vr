//! MC2 class-15 CAST MACHINERY + SPELL-XP — the spell column.
//! Ported from the remc2 cast chain (`EF:` = EventsFunctions.cpp,
//! `L:` = Level.cpp cites).
//!
//! Shape: a learned spell IS a class-15 pool entity (the collected
//! jar, re-purposed). Casting is multi-tick: the gate (`sub_5F660`)
//! arms the manifestation's cast timer; the manifestation's EFFECT
//! state (strF0[3·model]) then fires every tick while armed — first
//! tick spawns (the `sub_6DCA0` projectile dispatch or the direct-
//! effect arm) and commits the mana; the timer counts down; expiry
//! applies a pending tier change.
//!
//! Manifestation entity field map (class-15, this module):
//! `word_0x2E_46` armed cast timer → f26 · `word_0x30_48` duration &
//! mana divisor → f28 · `word_0x2C_44` pending tier+1 → f44 ·
//! `byte_0x46_70` live tier → f71 · `subSpellIndex_0x2A_42` payload
//! → f30 · `manaRegen_0x88_136` upkeep → f136 · `maxMana_0x8C_140`
//! full cost → max_life · `mana_0x90_144` per-tick mana → f140 ·
//! `word_0x36_54` cooldown → f54 · `parentId_0x28_40` owner → id24.
//!
//! The per-player `str_611` block lives on [`Mc2Spellbook`] — the
//! human wizard is out-of-pool (chassis convention), so the arrays
//! hang off `World` instead of a `dword_0xA4_164x` record. Single-
//! player laws only: the MP `xpos2` ladder and `sub_6DAD0` are out
//! of scope until rivals cast MC2-natively.
//!
//! Notes:
//! - The mana commit (`sub_68DE0` EF:55569) stamps the full cost as
//!   a negative caster manaRegen; [`World::mana_debit`] is the same
//!   mechanism (MC1's :64936 negative-delta stamp) — the regen tick
//!   applies it next turn, clamped at 0.
//! - Direct-effect spells map onto the existing Player channels
//!   (shield/invisible/rebound/beyond-sight/heal/accelerate/
//!   teleport); per-spell numeric payloads (heal rate, boost factor)
//!   reuse the MC1 channel plumbing pending their own deep trace.
//! - The castle spell (2) routes to [`World::cast_castle`]; retail's
//!   `sub_69AB0` build-queue variant is OPEN; the MC2 mana ladder
//!   (L:1729-55) applies either way.

    /// cheats, the respawn, the passive regen and MC1's two heal
    /// sites). Casting heal in MC2 restored nothing.
    ///
    /// The body is MC1's `sub_56270` skeleton with ONE structural
    /// difference, and that difference is the whole player-facing
    /// character of the spell:
    ///
    /// - **MC1** puts `actLife < maxLife` INSIDE the admission
    ///   (`sub_55DD0 && v1[3] < v1[2] && v1[35] >= +136`,
    ///   remc1 :65101-03), so a full-life tick takes the `else` and
    ///   RELEASES (`word_0x30_48 = 1`). The release is terminal —
    ///   nothing in retail resurrects a zeroed counter.
    /// - **MC2** admits on the gate and the purse ALONE and nests the
    ///   life test inside the accepted branch (:56445/:56450). A
    ///   full-life tick therefore falls through doing *nothing*: no
    ///   heal, no XP, **no debit** — and the window STAYS OPEN and
    ///   keeps re-testing. Get hurt while it runs and it starts
    ///   healing and charging again, mid-window.
    ///
    /// So the player's report — *"heal costs nothing if there's
    /// nothing to heal, no matter how many times it is cast, even
    /// though it appears active… if hurt while heal is active, it will
    /// start costing and healing again"* — is a composite of the two
    /// games: the first half holds in both, the second is MC2-only and
    /// structurally impossible in MC1 (see the SESSION 73 entry, where
    /// the MC1 half was measured and the mechanism read backwards from
    /// an identical observable).
    ///
    /// The other MC2-specific details, all from the same lines:
    /// - the amount is `maxLife * subSpellIndex_0x2A_42 / 100` (the
    ///   TIER drives the percentage) where MC1's is a flat 5%;
    /// - the admission carries an EXTRA `mana >= maxMana_0x8C_140` leg
    ///   on TOP of `sub_68D50` (:56445), so unlike every other MC2
    ///   spell heal re-checks affordability EVERY tick, not just the
    ///   `word_0x2E_46 == word_0x30_48` one — run dry mid-window and
    ///   it collapses;
    /// - the debit is the FULL cost stamped on the regen delta on
    ///   every HEALING tick (:56458-61), not a one-shot at the arm;
    /// - `sub_6A300` never calls `sub_68DE0`, so heal does NOT pin
    ///   mid-burst regen the way the skeleton's spells do;
    /// - the XP award (`sub_6D8B0(parent, 5, 1)` :56452) is on the
    ///   first HEALING tick, so a cast at full life scores nothing;
