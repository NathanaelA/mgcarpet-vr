//! band: (10,52) castle anchor, (10,25)/(10,23) one-shot blasts,
//! (10,17) meteor, (10,15) fire trail + its (10,11→19) ground-fire

//! (`EF:` = remc2 EventsFunctions.cpp).
//!
//! Entity-field homes follow the class-10 effect column: subSpell
//! (the area amount) → f140, `dword_0x10_16` scratch → f26,
//! `byte_0x46_70` → f71, `word_0x26_38` → f40.
//!
//! DELIBERATE APPROXIMATIONS (cited):
//! - `sub_6D8B0(id, kind, hits)` spellbook reports ((10,17) kind 9,
//!   (10,23) kind 7, (10,15)'s spray kind — the spell-XP intake):
//!   the hit counts are computed and dropped.
//! - The (10,19) spray's `word_0x33` singleton latch IS ported: the
//!   summit-18 eruption registers each new column and kills the
//!   previous (`plume`, morph.rs `mc2_summit18_tick` — EF:23962-64),
//!   and the spray's death releases it (`mc2_fire_spray_tick`,
//!   EF:24148). The old "no ported writer" note here was stale.
//! - `AddEvent2_847D0` attached lights/children ((10,23)'s
//!   (128,9,0)) are presentation, unported (the (10,1) note).
//! - The (10,54) aura scans retail's `dword_38523` creature list —
