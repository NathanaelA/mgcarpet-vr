//! MC2 rival wizards — the class-3 model-1 AI carpets on the MC2
//! column: lifecycle (spawn/records/authored castles), the per-tick
//! brain, the casting arm, mortality and respawn. Port of the remc2
//! machinery over the MC1 rival chassis; trace bank:
//! docs/traces/mc2-rivals-brain.md, mc2-rivals-spawn-mortality.md and
//! mc2-rivals-open-closure.md (`EF:` = remc2 EventsFunctions.cpp).
//!
//! The MC2 brain is the MC1 brain function-for-function (the
//! sub_12910 housekeeping/selector/handlers sandwich, the 0x601F hate
//! ledger, the burst gun, the poverty latch). What MC2 keys
//! differently:
//! - the SPELL IDS (heal 5, speed-up 3, possess 1, cloak 0xB,
//!   castle 2) and the recast/attack-priority tables (§7.2/7.3);
//! - the book is the class-15 manifestation entity per spell
//!   ([`Mc2Spellbook`] per rival), granted ONLY at load from the
//!   level's `WizardMapSettings` masks with authored starting tiers;
//!   MC2 has NO runtime spell learning (open-closure §3);
//! - the water/obstacle steer `sub_16580` runs after every state
//!   handler (open-closure §1 — MC1's AI flew over everything);
//! - death scatters the class-15 SPELL TOKENS (re-collectible), the
//!   respawn timer is a flat 1200, and a castle-less dead rival is
//!   BANISHED — the elimination signal the staged objective engine's
//!   case 3/8 reads;
//! - rivals earn NO spell XP — `sub_6D8B0`'s guard is class-3
//!   model-0, the human only (EF:58240-41); a rival's tiers are its
//!   authored map levels, and the per-cast TIER-DOWN walk
//!   (sub_15F20) supplies the tier dynamics.
//!
//! Original asymmetries, ported as traced: the AI at its own castle
//! DISCARDS damage (grace pinned 2, mailbox memset — EF:5400-5414;
//! the at-castle FORWARD is human-only, EF:59961); AI life regen /200
//! home /500 afield (4x the human afield); the AI carpet ignores
//! walls and knockback but — new in MC2 — steers around WATER; target
//! scans are omniscient.
//!
//! Open interim deviations (ours, flagged inline): the hate feed
//! rides damage intake instead of the per-projectile scan sub_159E0
//! (the MC1-column position); the DEFENSE state's disguise VISUAL
//! (retail draws the metamorph creature in place of the AI carpet) is
//! presentation-side unported — the state machine, tier pick,
//! shadowing and speed law are faithful (sub_15FC0/sub_161A0).

///    can elect a different record.
/// 2. **A `>` GATE IS OFF BY A SQUARE ROOT.** `isqrt(D) >= C` really
///    is `D >= C*C`, and `isqrt(D) < C` really is `D < C*C` — so the
///    port's `>=`/`<` gates were accidentally exact. But
///    `isqrt(D) > C` is `D >= (C+1)²`, NOT `D > C²`. Retail's
///    `sub_15FC0` scan-1 gate is `cmpl $0x1400,-0xc(%ebp); jbe` at
///    file **0x3a87b** (EF:7657) — i.e. drop when `isqrt(D) > 5120`,
///    which keeps the whole band `D ∈ (5120², 5121²]` that the port
///    dropped. `sub_161A0`'s lower band edge `cmp $0xa00,%esi; jbe` at
///    file **0x3ab74** (EF:7801) has the same shape. The upper edges
