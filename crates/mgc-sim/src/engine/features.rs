//! The shared chassis engine state and load-time terrain features
//! ("GenerateFeatures"). A verbatim remc1 port of the low-level engine
//! state — the shared entity pool ([`Gen`]) and the load-time feature
//! pass — used by all three games (MC1, Hidden Worlds, MC2).
//!
//! Port of remc1's `GenerateFeatures_36430_367F0` (sub_main.cpp:43043):
//! the entity-driven post-generation phase that carves craters and
//! canyons, raises walls and ridges, paints tracks, and flattens/paints
//! building footprints into the pristine generated terrain. Baked
//! `.mgcl` terrain stays pristine by design (docs/FORMAT.md); the
//! engine applies these modifications at level load from `things.json`.
//!
//! Machinery (line references are remc1 sub_main.cpp):
//!
//! - Level entities with `class == 10 && dis_id == 0xFFFF` are terrain
//!   features, consumed in slot order 1..1999. Chained models (28
//!   walls, 29 tracks, 31 canyons, 50 ridges, with `swi_id != 0` as
//!   the not-yet-processed flag) run a polyline walker (sub_362C0,
//!   :42972): root-first via `parent` links, then one segment function
//!   per parent→child pair. Everything else spawns a runtime *event*
//!   through its per-model creator (`off_97D12`, :5075); model 45
//!   (building) additionally gets the footprint fix-up sub_36DF0.
//! - The event loop (sub_36620, :43181) then sweeps the 1000-slot
//!   event pool to fixpoint: craters dig ring by ring, canyon heads
//!   walk and spawn diggers, buildings flatten and paint over 30
//!   ticks, and every non-feature event is purged. Dispatch is by the
//!   entity's byte-70 tick index, not its model.
//! - Determinism: the pool allocates slots 1,2,3,… (free stack built
//!   999→1; frees push back LIFO), and each event seeds a per-entity
//!   LCG from `slot + global_rand`. Two behaviors depend on the slot
//!   number itself: digger radius growth (`slot % 3`, sub_25670) and
//!   dither draws — so slot churn from events that are spawned only to
//!   be purged is load-bearing and reproduced exactly.
//! - PRNG streams (all `x = 9377x + 9439`): the global u32 `rand_4` is
//!   the level seed at scan time and is advanced exactly once at event
//!   loop entry; retiling draws the u16 `pseudoRand` stream whose
//!   post-generation state is replayed from the height plane
//!   ([`post_generation_pseudo_rand`], the generator's shading pass
//!   reset it to 0 and drew once per flat tile).
//!
//! Deliberately omitted (terrain-neutral at load): damage broadcasts
//! (sub_127E0/sub_120B0 — they write damage fields on pool entities;
//! relevant once entities persist), sounds, and the surviving building
//! entities themselves (the entity track will need them; the terrain
//! effect is complete without).
//!
//! Entity-table indices: `things.json` slots are 0-based file order;
//! the engine indexes the same records 1-based (its record 1 = file
//! offset 0x442 = our slot 0), and `parent`/`child` values are those
//! 1-based indices. The pass rebuilds the 1-based table.
