//! Retail-bug patch switches — the sim half of the `gameplay ·
//! patches` option class (docs/DEVIATIONS.md "Patch options").
//!
//! Each field is one deliberate upstream bugfix with BOTH arms
//! implemented: `true` runs the patched (fixed) behavior, `false`
//! runs retail's shipped bug. The struct is config-like — never part
//! of the state hash or the snapshot stream — and defaults to
//! [`WorldPatches::RETAIL`] at world construction, so every direct
//! `World::new*` consumer (goldens, unit tests, mgc-conform, which
//! never reads app config) evolves under retail law unless the app
//! explicitly opts a patch in. Conformance imports additionally
//! re-force RETAIL as a belt (`World::strict_retail` remains the
//! overriding kill-switch at the gated sites).
//!
//! Reach: `World` methods read `self.patches`; Gen-side ticks get it
//! through [`crate::mc1::mobs::MobCtx::patches`] where a ctx already
//! flows, or as an explicit parameter on the castle/building lanes
//! (the `strict` precedent — a Gen field would drag the wholesale
