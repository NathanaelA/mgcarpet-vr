//! MC1 combat: damage mailboxes, class-9 projectiles, class-10
//! combat effects (fire/explosion, fire-spreader, splash, blast ring,
//! hit-flash, mana-steal flash, mana ball) and the corpse pipeline —
//! ports of remc1 sub_main.cpp. Full specs in docs/ROADMAP.md
//! ("Combat, damage, death & corpses", "Fireball / repeat fireball").
//!
//! Deviations from the decompile:
//! - `sub_12B50`'s inverted accumulate/overwrite is NOT ported; the
//!   direct write uses the area writers' protocol (:17301-05)
//!   (deliberate: suspect transcription swap, like :21814).
//! - The m9 ranged thunk aims at the TARGET, not the atan2(0,0)
//!   self-aim (:21947-48) (deliberate: decompile casualty).
//! - (RETIRED) Aim assist now runs sub_54A90's exact distance-weighted
//!   score, 2-D range and v_28 class-3 pre-gate in every acquire
//!   subtype (see `Gen::acquire_score`); the Δyaw² + Δpitch²
//!   approximation is gone.
//! - The m9 lightning BEAM (sub_535E0 :63272) is a full port (one-tick
//!   hitscan walk + state-14 segment chain, confirmed vs remc2
//!   sub_66750); the explosion's +146 stamps hit-or-0 where the
//!   original writes garbage on a miss (deliberate).
//! - Class-9 model 14 / state 15 (the Troll & Ape boulder): remc1's
//!   class-9 tick table is truncated, but CARPET.EXE's relocated
//!   table binds 0xF to the bare sub_52770 thunk — the boulder runs
//!   the generic homing flight (no fire trail, no acquire for m14),
//!   pre-targeted by its throw ctor. It must NOT alias onto state
//!   13, whose first-tick roll is the arrow quartet.
//! - Mana-shield reflection (+17 bit 7) is ported but nothing sets the
//!   flag yet (OPEN: wizard shields are the spell track).

        // constant, `(w>>1) - bump + (h>>1)*w`, the mask's own centre
        // cell. The only writer-dependence left is the parity bump,
        // which picks the centre or the cell left of it. THE CORPUS
        // ARBITRATES AND IT IS UNAMBIGUOUS: mc2l0 t=3192→3193, four
        // ground fires overlap building 196 (row 37, a 5x5 mask at
        // tile 171,207) at `d = (-1,1)`, `(-1,2)`, `(2,-2)` and
        // `(2,2)` — three of them OUTSIDE the footprint entirely —
        // and retail pays all four (1600 = 4x400). Probing the
        // building's own corner pays exactly the one writer standing
        // on a solid cell, and that 400-per-fire shortfall was the
        // whole residue left after the roster law below. Landing this
        // moves mc2l0's free horizon 3221 → 3240.
